-- Insert admin user (this will be created after you set up authentication)
-- You can run this manually in your Supabase SQL editor after setting up auth

-- First, you need to create the admin user through Supabase Auth
-- Then insert the profile record

-- Example admin profile (replace with actual user ID after creating auth user)
-- INSERT INTO profiles (id, name, role) VALUES 
-- ('your-admin-user-id-here', 'Admin User', 'admin');

-- For now, this is just a placeholder file
-- The actual admin user will be created through the signup process
